quote 0: I'm not as certain about Tremaine Edmunds. I know that he's a great, great athlete. I think that's obvious. I think my daughters could see that. The question is -- I didn't see a great player on tape. Normally, if you're going to draft a stack linebacker in the NFL high, and that's what he did in college, his athletic ability would lead you to believe he can do other things and I know he's young. So he's tantalizing for teams because may they see him down the road as being far more than he was at Virginia Tech. But normally if you draft a stack linebacker really high; you think of the Patrick Willises and the Luke Keuchlys. I didn't see that kind of player on tape. That doesn't mean he can't become that and he's only about 20 years old. Just watching tape, I think he's a little bit of a projection and I think he's a little bit of a potential guy, despite the fact that he's a great, great athlete.probs: 1.0

quote 0: He's playing at a high level right now. I don't think people are talking about him enough. He's top three in the league in rushing average.

If there's a crease within your defense he'll see it, and he'll shoot through. We've had a string of really good running backs we've been playing against.
