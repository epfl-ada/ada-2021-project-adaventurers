If there is no deal and if the trade measures escalate, then this would be a negative for the currency, the growth outlook and the equity market. A lot will hinge on what happens in the U.S.-China trade war, and if a deal can be concluded in the first half of this year.

I just want to give myself that challenge. I want to experience as many things as possible before I slow down and start a family or something.

quote 2: I see a straight contest between the Congress and SAD-BJP.

It's the Congress that is to blame. Do you know a Congress leader termed (former prime minister) Atal Bihari Vajpayee a traitor?

quote 1: Mack doesn't do anything fancy on the field, but he's on point most of the time. When he gets his hands on a defender's numbers, he has the strength and drive to push that defender wherever he wants him to go. And though he's not the most agile center in the league, he has a solid backpedal, and he knows how to use his hands in pass protection... Mack retains his status as one of the league's most technically correct centers.
quote 2: Doumbouya looks like an NBA combo forward physicality at just 18 years old. He has multiple years of professional experience already in France, showing potential as a long, strong 6' 8 forward who can make plays in transition and finish through contact. He is also extremely raw right now, making this more of a developmental pick than one that will impact the Pistons next season. The Pistons have to be patient. If they are, this pick might just pay off.

quote 4: Indeed, its very title, `Civic Biology,' made it clear that biology had direct political implications for civic society. In discussing the `five races' of man, the text assured the all-white, legally segregated high school students taught by Scopes that `the highest type of all, the Caucasians, (are) represented by the civilized white inhabitants of Europe and America.' The book, the avowed goal of which was the improvement of the future human race, then proposed certain eugenic remedies.

quote 0: That's definitely the target -- to try to use our tyre advantage, especially at the start, to gain positions and then try to keep them. Keeping them will be very difficult because they are extremely quick in race runs but that's the target.
quote 1: Every race meeting I practise on the Saturday, straight into racing on the Sunday, which is very tense. Your weight is checked after every race to make sure no-one is cheating, as that could get you disqualified.
quote 2: It's a shame for everyone in the Team to lose a podium here as the car felt very good and we were so quick in the race. The battles with Charles were hard but fair and he was defending really well. I didn't want to risk too much as the race was still very long and we were clearly faster, so it was just a matter of choosing the right time and it was great fun. The Team made a really good call with the second pit stop to put me on the hard tyre so we had that advantage over Charles. I then had really strong pace and caught Seb, I passed him and defended into Turn 17 but Seb out braked himself and hit me from behind. I ended up bumping over the kerbs and the gravel and I thought the race was over. I honestly don't know how I brought the car to the finish as it felt like the power steering failed and the floor was damaged, so I'm actually happy to finish fifth and score some points. I'm not angry but disappointed as it was hard racing and Seb didn't do it on purpose. He also apologised as soon as I got out of the car which I respect. I think we put on a pretty good show for the fans today and proved the sport is far from boring.
quote 3: I don't know what to say, congrats to Lewis, he got a free stop and got past me there. Not really my day but the pace was good. There are positives for yesterday in qualifying as I was quickest on track. I'll keep fighting this season, it's not over yet.
quote 4: Apart from that, our race pace was really good, and the initial laps went well and I benefited from the Safety Car to get ahead of three cars. I don't think we could have won today, but I'm not happy that I didn't even score any points.

quote 0: The Louisiana Democratic Party continues to decline under a Democratic governor, John Bel Edwards. The one bright spot for the party is that Edwards is the frontrunner heading into the Oct. 12 gubernatorial primary against two Republican challengers, U.S. Rep. Ralph Abraham and businessman Eddie Rispone. But the number of registered Democrats in Louisiana has continued to shrink since Edwards became governor in January 2016, and the Republicans' majority in the state Legislature continues to widen. Last week, no Democrat even qualified to try to replace three rural House Democrats who are leaving the lower chamber because of term limits. As a result, Republicans are now within striking distance of winning two-thirds of the seats in the House and Senate in the upcoming elections.

quote 1: an African-American woman parked her car in two spaces and an 80-year-old white man got into an argument with her. The argument boiled over when the man began engaging in childish name-calling and kicking.... While the man used a well-known racial epithet, there was no evidence that he harbored actual ill feelings toward African-Americans as a group. The `group' he really had a beef with was people who take up two spaces with one car. But Santa Monica College police took him into custody (rightly, since he committed a battery) and the act was classified as a hate crime (without more facts, perhaps wrongly).

quote 1: I suspect that will make it easier to schedule a day-night Test next season if India has relative certainty of making the World Test Championship final, then there is less reason not to play a day-night Test and more reason to play one. Also, with Sourav Ganguly coming into the presidency of the BCCI, he has been really proactive in scheduling the first day-night Test in India and we saw that was a sell-out in the first three days which is very different to what the previous day series have looked like in terms of ticket sales.

So we have to improve the way we batted and our captain [ Dasun Shanaka ] played exceptionally well in the first game. He got us to 174. Rest of us has to play little better against this Dhaka team. But it is a good sign we didn't play as well as we could but still we won the first game,
