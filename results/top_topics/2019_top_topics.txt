quote 2: Our family has matured single malt whiskies for 123 years, each generation passing on its knowledge of how to combine spirit and oak to create exquisite whiskies. Four generations of my family have carefully nurtured Cask 2154 over its 70 years to produce this unique whisky. My great-grandfather, John, selected the first fill Sherry butt in 1948 to fill with new-make spirit from Glen Grant. My family has patiently watched over this cask, regularly monitoring and sampling the whisky, recognizing the right moment to bottle it at its ultimate peak. This masterpiece epitomizes the skill and craft involved in matching a cask to new-make spirit, as well as our dedication to creating unique and intriguing whiskies. Thanks to the notable influence of the Sherry butt on the spirit over the years, the elegant whisky displays flavours of dried fruit, orange zest, and cracked black pepper whilst maintaining a long, smooth charred oak finish. The remarkable 70-year-old malt also has delicate smoky notes, a reminder that, in 1948, the distillerywould have been using traditional practices on their floor maltings and local peat as a fuel.probs: 1.0

quote 0: Probably our worst loss ever. Difficult one to explain. We were outplayed in all departments by a quality side. This showed why they are former champions and finalists. (Different things they could have tried) We could have tried different things, like bouncers. They batted really well once they got in. Few of the edges fell into vacant areas. Brilliant to sustain intent for the first 16-17 overs. We've thought about (scoring runs in the early overs) but I feel myself at 3, and AB and me batting together brings us more balance. We still have 11 games, and things can turn around quite quickly in this league. We have to capitalise on that in the next games. (Against Rajasthan next) When things don't go our way, we will have to find ways of winning moments. You need to start well, and the next game should be that game for us.probs: 1.0

quote 1: St Vincent's Hospital was started in a rented house on East 13th St. in 1849 by four nuns from the Sisters of Charity during one of the cholera epidemics which periodically swept through the city in the 19th century. It was the first Catholic hospital in Manhattan. Survivors of disasters such as the sinking of the Titanic, the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory Fire and 9/11 were treated in the hospital after it moved to its eventual site on 7th Avenue in 1856. But the central mission of St Vincent's was to provide medical care to generations of people living on the West Side.

By the time St Vincent's closed its doors on April 30, 2010, 3500 employees had lost their jobs. The last Catholic hospital in Manhattan was replaced by a luxury condo development.probs: 1.0

quote 2: SLEEPER ALERT!! Elias is a Cuban defector signed by the Mariners in 2011. He's received almost no attention, but he had a really nice year in the California League, not an easy thing to do when pitching for High Desert. He's a thin lanky lefty with an average fastball, but his curveball is very good, he throws strikes, knows how to pitch, and is said to perform very well under pressure. It remains to be seen if he's a future fifth starter, relief option, or just a minor league inning soaker, but anyone who survives High Desert with his confidence (and his statistics) intact needs to be watched closely in Double-A, whether or not he shows up on top prospect lists. Grade C but very interesting.probs: 1.0

Thinking that is a possibility to win on grass, it was tough to believe because we don't even have a court, grass court, in Romania. That's something far. But I knew if we be patient and if we work hard, we get the feeling of the grass court. So I did this year and I did it pretty well. Mr. [ Ion ] Tiriac is helping me since 2014 when I first talked to him. He called me after that Madrid final when I lost against Sharapova. He was not very happy. But he told me that I have a good future. If I work hard and I'm a professional, I have very big chances to win Grand Slams.

quote 0: So the fact that he is reluctant to make the Spence-Crawford fight indicates to me that he has serious doubts about his guy winning the fight. We wan na do the fight because we think that Terence Crawford is the best welterweight in the world, and will beat Spence, and we're prepared to do that fight on a 50/50 basis. The fact that Haymon hasn't really jumped at that and is having difficulty with Spence, because he can't pay him the right kind of money to fight other guys like Porter and so on, `cause it's not there, indicates to me that he doesn't have enough confidence in Spence beating Crawford to do that fight. It's as simple as that!probs: 1.0
quote 1: He's knocked some guys out, so he's confident in his striking, but his striking is very chaotic, I feel sloppy, and that can overwhelm people.

quote 5: I think it's a very interesting matchup. We got to see just a little glimpse of it last time, and obviously, it was over pretty quick. I think it's going to kind of play out similar. I think DC is just coming from the lighter weight. I think the heavyweight guys are just a hair slower, and that was what kind of gave Stipe a little problem last time, so I think that's kind of be the same thing. DC is as tough as they come, and he's always done good against big punchers, so I don't see him getting hit with a big right hand that Stipe hits everybody with, so I think he's just an overall better mixed martial artist.probs: 1.0

Amid an intensifying row with Brussels, the prime minister will warn the German chancellor over dinner in Berlin that there will be no Brexit agreement unless the EU backs down and agrees to scrap the Irish backstop. The tough approach comes after Leo Varadkar, the Irish prime minister, highlighted attempts by Remainer Tory MPs to stop a no-deal Brexit during a one-hour call with Mr Johnson on Monday night. Downing Street believes that Brussels is unlikely to enter into negotiations over a new agreement while parliamentary attempts to stop a no-deal exit and potentially bring down Mr Johnson's government continue.probs: 1.0

All of this gives regulators more flexibility to horizon scan and intervene in deals where there is less obvious immediate harm, and makes the process less predictable for business. Then, of course, there is Brexit.
