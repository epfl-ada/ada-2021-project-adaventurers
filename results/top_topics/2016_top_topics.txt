quote 4: In general, you'll find much more positive reinforcement towards a desire to write -- and simply be creative in general -- if you're a white male than you are if you're a woman or a person of color. There seems to be an almost inherent sense that writing is somehow `not for them,' which couldn't possibly be further from the truth and is a dangerous point of view for society to foster. If you unpack it a bit, it makes sense -- one writer I talked to a while back summed it up as, `My parents and grandparents didn't risk their lives and bust their asses through the pre - and post-Civil Rights era for me to get an MFA.' And I think that's an understandable fear for first-generation Americans or those who are just now starting to creep towards equal rights especially -- that those who came before them did so, so they could become doctors and lawyers and engineers and have the same opportunities that male, white kids do. And that's not difficult to appreciate. The problem is that such a cultural mindset can snuff out creative voices before they even form.probs: 1.0

quote 2: He's 21 years old, but he's been playing regularly and with many playing minutes in the league for three years!

They say that players start reaching the peak of their performance and of their career when they've been playing in the NBA for 6 or 7 seasons. Giannis got in the league when he was 18 years old. So, in his case, we have to look at a player like LeBron, who played straight in the NBA without playing in college. The general rule says that good players reach their peak between 27 and 29.

And then you're gon na get in there with a little bit of tomato and lettuce but not too much cause it's not a salad, it's a taco, and then you're gon na throw some avocado on top and some sour cream and then a bunch of Cholula. I don't know if you know what Cholula hot sauce is but it's the best. Throw a bunch of Cholula on there, maybe squeeze some lime on top, and go to town.probs: 1.0

quote 2: There's only one way to go for him and that's forward. He's made progress so far. (The power) is there. It needs to play in a game and I think in time it will.

quote 3: I mean, he's one of the best pitchers in the game for a reason.

quote 5: I wanted to show him some things on similar players that have struggled in their careers or struggled in their first couple years and then all of a sudden the power number starts to spike because the on-base started to climb. The batting average slowly climbs, sometimes goes down, but that's okay. I'm not trying to shape him, but I'm trying to give him a better idea because I feel like that's where he was lost.
