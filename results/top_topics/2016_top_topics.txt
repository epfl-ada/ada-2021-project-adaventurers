quote 0: we're the only one with sizeable market share,
quote 1: ... we believe the stock could find some support from activist involvement.

Amex has high expenses relative to peers, and we believe there is opportunity to cut some overhead.
quote 2: There won't be necessity to amend the laws. However, there are a lot of practical issues that are currently being put in place. Banks are in touch with the Finance Ministry,

quote 0: Holding them to 33 felt good. I wished we scored more than 20. Their defense was just as good.
quote 1: I thought our pressure defense was really the staple for us the entire tournament. I give Arnold a lot of credit. They responded well and didn't quit. They kept battling and we had to change up our defense a little bit. Coach Britton has done a great job with his kids, but we're pleased with our performance.
quote 2: They got over our line and it was a big call on the try. Once they went ten points up it was a big ask.
quote 3: Their defense defended us better than anyone has defended us the last two years
quote 4: In that second quarter, we got a lot of good looks, but things weren't falling. I can count five layups that didn't go in. That's 10 points. That's a big difference.

quote 1: The current decline in prices should therefore be seen as a great opportunity to buy art now,
quote 2: The shares are off 3% on lowered 2016 sales guidance that is below consensus. We welcome the move to more sensible and achievable top-line targetry, and applaud the good work on cash generation. Nestle is guiding to 2016 organic sales in line with 2015 and is cautioning in quarterly volatility around this number, with the lapping of the Maggi withdrawal expected to impact H1. We view guidance as sensible and achievable (we had been forecasting 4.3%) but it implies downgrades relative to consensus +4.7%. But what's missing from the equation is margin progress, where we were disappointed by the lack of any firmer commitment, given potential tailwinds in 2016. With growth expectations lowered, the focus of questioning on the call was on margins, with voices in the market clearly looking for a commitment to zero-based budgeting along the lines of Unilever, Diageo, Mondelez International and Kraft Heinz. Nestle insists its ongoing commitment to `business excellence' will suffice here, but we were disappointed not to hear something more decisive. We also have a concern that focus on constant fx margins (rather than the reported fx margin that shareholders actually get) will make NESN inattentive to reducing the CHF cost base. All that said, pricing vs. commodities should continue to be favourable in 2016 and many of 2015's headwinds shouldn't recur. Something to noodle on, then

quote 0: JNU has always been a very happening place. It's a laboratory for experiment for so many ideas and ideologies. If some anti-national slogans have been raised here, I criticise it. But somewhere down the line I would always say that JNU has given me a lot. It has improved my personality, my vision and the kind of equality I have seen at JNU, it is unmatched in the whole country,

quote 1: [ Raising our budget ] was a combination of personal investment from friends and family members, as well as crowdfunding. We had a Kickstarter campaign with a goal of $10,000 and we eventually received around $14,000, so on those terms we were pretty successful. As far as challenges, I think initially it was just a matter of convincing people that we could make the movie we wanted to make with the resources we had available to us. I think sometimes people hear `I' m making a movie in my mom's house with a bunch of friends and family members' and sort of roll their eyes. But Trey had big ambitions for the film, so it was just a matter of conveying that to those who ended up contributing to the project.

quote 0: Donald J. Trump: Think Like a Champion
quote 1: We have worked hard and had some really tough sessions,
quote 2: He was not successful in uniting the GOP within the hall or across the country. His links to the party and elected officials remain weak. Much of the vitriol from the delegates was poor TV and sounded extreme, reinforcing the GOP's image problem with many voters.
quote 3: Even though we disagree on policy and principle, I respect him,
quote 4: (Trump's) appeal is in the forbidden delight in hearing highly inappropriate things spoken into a microphone... His supporters are not really listening to anything he says... Nothing in Trump's platform matters. There is no policy that matters. There is no promise that matters. There is only the man, the name, the brand, the personality they have seen on television... he is entertainment... a loud, captivating distraction... His appeal is... fuelled not by substance but by his willingness to say crazy shit

quote 0: Crime movies from the 70s -- the ones by Peter Yates and William Friedkin and John Cassavetes and Don Siegel -- are not only very sexist, they're incredibly grim and violent, and any character can die at any time.

quote 1: As bad as the figures are that have been released to me, I also know that they in no way reflect the extended periods of time people are actually waiting. I have cases of people who are waiting four years for access to the ENT services. This is completely ludicrous and is imposing massive strain on the people affected by these issues. There is also an explicit acknowledgement in the reply that the population of South Tipperary in particular is not receiving `equitable access,' which the HSE are attributing to population size relative to the other geographic catchment areas in the South East. As things stand patients in South Tipperary must now wait until the effects of the recently launched strategy for the `Design of Integrated Outpatient Services' kicks in. Yet there is no guarantee that this strategy is going to be any more effective that the last. All of this puts into even starker relief the nonsense of having a state of the art facility at Our Lady's in Cashel that will most likely never see a residential patient. It is anyone's guess at this stage whether the top level of the HSE has a clue about how to address massive waiting lists and insuring that people are seen in a timely and appropriate manner. Instead, all the evidence to date suggests that we have masters of `strategy formation' who end up making situations worse,
