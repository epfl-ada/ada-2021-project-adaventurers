Other presidents have at least done a pantomime of the qualities that we try to instill in children: humility, honesty, magnanimity, generosity. Even Nixon took his stabs at these. Trump makes a proud and almost ceaseless mockery of them. It's one thing to fall short of them, as so many presidents have. It's quite another to step onto the inaugural stage, put your hand on the Bible and then go out of your way to belittle the past presidents who are sitting just a few feet away.

quote 5: The president tweeted on Friday after I got fired that I better hope there's not tapes. I woke up in the middle of the night on Monday night because it didn't dawn on me originally, that there might be corroboration for our conversation. There might be a tape. My judgment was, I need to get that out into the public square. I asked a friend of mine to share the content of the memo with a reporter. Didn't do it myself for a variety of reasons. I asked him to because I thought that might prompt the appointment of a special counsel.probs: 1.0

quote 0: I think everybody can always do that in one way or another, whether it's physical or mental or learning about the league. Trevor's last game, other than the last couple hitters, man, I'm not sure how much better you can pitch. Velocity. Command of all his pitches. He's held his stuff, in my opinion, probably better than he ever has and it's even getting stronger. But I think, when he's not working behind in the count and things like that, you're going to see him get deeper and you're going to see him take the sting out of guys' bats, because he's not pitching from behind.probs: 1.0
quote 1: He got it solid for sure. That ball left in a hurry. But then again, it's Bryce. Any time you hear a loud sound like that, you know it's going somewhere far and fast.

quote 3: I think it will have a positive effect on the racing seen this season. The restrictor plates will bunch us all back up and make passing more frequent. In the past, the cars always seem to spread out so much that it was extremely difficult to pass anyone and put on a good show for the fans. This year, we will be bunched up, drafting a little bit and able to move around a little more easily. It should be an exciting race. I actually tested this package earlier this season. There were only three of us out there, but we were in a draft pretty much the entire time. That will only increase in intensity with a whole field out there running so close together. It's a track that still requires help to pass someone, but with other cars out there it shouldn't be too hard to get a run and make some moves.probs: 1.0

Over the years, the company has consistently returned significant cash to its shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. The company's investment strategy takes a holistic view of the rapidly evolving market and deploys a dynamic capital allocation approach to focus on the relative value of the various sectors within the broader industry. Cintas has also outperformed the industry year to date. However, volatility in raw material prices and third-party supply constraints remain potential headwinds for the company.probs: 1.0

quote 0: Since my resignation from the Board of Infosys, I have kept away from making any public statements, despite provocations, since I sincerely want the Company to move forward, and not be bogged down with the issues of the past. Mr. Murthy's statement to the investors reported by the Press, however, forces me to issue this statement, which is done only to defend myself against personal attacks and patently false and slanderous accusations. Mr. Murthy's statement to the investors misleadingly attributes words to me that are taken completely out of context, making it appear that I was not stating the truth. I wish to categorically state that I have always been candid and truthful in all my statements concerning Infosys. To quote an anonymous whistleblower letter that alleged many things, which have subsequently been proved baseless and false through multiple investigations by highly respected counsel, in order to give an impression to the audience that I lied to the shareholders, is patently offensive.. The words that Mr. Murthy attributes to Jeff Lehman and Roopa Kudva, from their private conversation with him are also egregiously taken out of context. It is regrettable that Mr. Murthy's campaign on the alleged governance lapses has continually slipped into personal attacks and slander on individual Board members. I would also like to point out that Mr. Murthy invited me to join the Board and entrusted to me the Chair of the Audit Committee, while he was still the Chairman. As late as February' 17, much after the alleged lapses took place, Mr. Murthy also issued a press statement that I was a man of high integrity. I am therefore at a loss to understand the motivations for this persistent vendetta against me.probs: 1.0

It's not that hard to do a middle class tax cut if you're deficit financing it. They freed up $1.5 trillion and they still couldn't do a straightforward middle-class tax cut.
