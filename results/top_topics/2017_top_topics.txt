quote 3: If he played now he could be one of the best players in the country in the open court. He's so fast and athletic. I mean he's like 6 - (foot) -6 with like a 7-foot wingspan. It's extremely difficult to stop him,

quote 0: My hair was breaking. My chest was always burning from the bulimia. My nails got weak. I was very, very thin. And I was really unhappy. I was incapable of having good, loving relationships. I closed myself off in my house.... It's odd, but I was a very good yoga instructor at the time, but I was a disaster at helping myself, of taking care of myself well enough.
quote 1: I felt a pop-pop-pop-pop-pop, and then there was nothing left to pop,
quote 2: I hope to do some of the same things I did last time. For instance, it was important to me when Viola was born that they didn't wash her immediately. I read that the mucus that babies are covered in is really good for their skin, so I wanted it to seep in and not be scrubbed off. I didn't [ have music playing ] last time, but I sang the Rocky theme song between pushes! My doula said, `Make sure that you have a good story to tell afterward.' And we did. It was a beautiful September day, and when it was time to deliver, Brian and I walked to the hospital through Central Park.
quote 3: It's something that I've just tried to distract myself from and push that aside as much as I can.
quote 4: I wrote `Head Over Boots,' and that was a twist on `Head Over Heels' -- a country version of a love song. I didn't write `Dirt on my Boots,' but it reminded me of when I was in my 20s: getting off the tractor, going home, showering and picking up a girl to have a good time. I was like, `Dude, I've totally done that. '

So I think when it gets calm, maybe he'll show up. I feel like he has to because it's Grey's Anatomy and that's what they do; we bring people back from your past who are unexpected. He's been the elephant in the room for a long time now, and I think it's time to meet him.

quote 1: Our country's immigration policies should be designed and implemented to serve, first and foremost, the U.S. national interest.

quote 2: the opportunity for a more rational immigration policy
quote 3: I don't think that will change. I think there are many who think that is changing with this administration, with this immigration notice, but in reality, it does very little to change what we've done historically to help refugees in this nation.
quote 4: We should not simply turn away individuals who already have lawful U.S. visas or green cards -- like those who have risked their lives serving alongside our forces overseas or who call America their home,

quote 0: One interesting question is whether this new justice is going to be an `Article 2' conservative, interested in protecting presidential power, or an `Article 3' conservative who wants to emphasize the court's' role in the constitutional structure,
quote 1: and the tears of Senator Schumer.
quote 2: I'm glad [ Democrats ] have the right to filibuster, but since we have a Republican Congress and president, I feel like it's inevitable that we will get a more conservative Supreme Court justice nominee through [ the Senate ],
quote 3: less of an originalist than Scalia was, but he had some of the same elements of Scalia,
quote 4: Long before his election, President Trump promised to appoint a Supreme Court justice in the mold of Antonin Scalia, who held a deeply conservative view of the Constitution and the Court. In the coming weeks, I will be closely examining Neil Gorsuch's background, but I have serious concerns about his judicial philosophy -- especially on issues like access to justice, corporate accountability, workers' rights, and women's health. I was hopeful that the President would have selected someone like Merrick Garland, a consensus candidate lauded by the same Republicans who ultimately refused to hold a hearing on him for nearly a year.

You can have the best paint job in the world, but if it's not prepped properly, then it's kind of a waste.

Chief Steve Anderson believes in a well-disciplined police force and making sure all officers protect the integrity and reputation of the MNPD, which is why the recent Vanderbilt poll shows that 80% of Nashvillians approve of the job the MNPD is doing. So I'm not pursuing a civilian review board at this time, but will still gather information and hear from members of the public on the issue.

Congressional negotiators had been working through the weekend to hash out the last remaining complications in a bill to fund the government. After President Donald Trump backed down on funding for the construction of a border wall, some additional sticking points remained, including health benefits for coal miners, funding for Puerto Rico and an additional $30 billion for defense, delaying congressional negotiators and causing them to miss their deadline of Friday.

They have to stay outside of the area, and I think that's a handicap for the area. Anyone who's looking to sink millions of dollars into a project here in Amsterdam isn't going to find professional accommodations to stay there, so why would they invest when their CEO wants to visit the facility and they need to stay out of the area.

quote 1: Leah could be the most athletic young woman we've ever had join us. She's a very competitive track athlete in the state and thankfully made the choice to pursue field hockey! We're looking at her in the midfield where she'll be able to use her speed, agility, and fitness to get up and down the field. She's also been a member of our local club team for quite some time, and we've been lucky to watch her grow into a strong leader and amazing young player. The next step is her transition to the faster ball speed and higher tempo at the college game where her strengths will show even more.

quote 0: The 10-day deal certainly helped us, five days shorter than previous seasons. Miggy is a guy you want all year. He's a guy who generally plays 150-something games and is one of the best hitters in any league. We obviously want him back. We think he'll be back (Tuesday) and hopefully he's healthy the rest of the way.
quote 1: He's probably good for 90 (pitches) next time out,
quote 2: so when Trevor says somebody hits a ball that they shouldn't of hit, when you're at 100 pitches after 4 1/3 innings, you're showing hitters a lot of pitches. You get to a point where you have to make a perfect pitch. When he does, he's fine. When he doesn't, he gives up a lot of damage.
quote 3: And he got behind and had some deep counts. But there was some resiliency there and he hung with it, even not pitching as good as we have seen him overall. That's going to happen.
quote 4: It's always dangerous to play the on-pace-for game. (Ryan Zimmerman is currently batting.435, for crying out loud.) But if anything, (Bryce) Harper's pace in the past week has slowed to its current level. And just calling this a hot streak ignores that Harper has essentially done this for a whole season before. In his MVP season of 2015, Harper put up a.330 /.460 /.649 slash line. Harper will actually have to regress significantly to fall to that epic, magnificent season. To match 2015, Harper's slash line the rest of the way would be.319 /.451 /.630. You think he's got that in him? I think he's got better. Let's say, for the sake of discussion, Harper puts up 45 homers a year, this year and the next seven years. That seems about right: He may go nuts and go over that number a couple of years, he may miss some games or have a down year or so. He may sign with the Yankees and their short right-field porch in that time -- though it's possible the Braves' new stadium may be even better for left-handed power hitters -- and go nuts for 70 sometime. But let's go with 45. That gives him 36 more this year, plus 45 a year for the six years after that. That's 306 homers, added to the 130 he has already hit. That puts him at 446 at the end of the 2023 season. How old will he be after that 446th homer, as he tries to win the Yankees another championship? He will be 31 years old.

quote 0: Not many do that anymore these days. When you don't hear it, whenever someone who necessarily doesn't like rock and roll comes to our show, they go' I love it. I'm having a good time! I'm digging it; I'm digging the music and melody.' I think music needs to have melody. To me, anyways, now lately, the past few years there have been a lot of artists who mainly just talk over drumbeats or some people who just growl; that kind of metal stuff where they're all sounding similar when they're not singing any melody and they're growling [ makes growling noise ] and they're [ singing ] `Satan!' and `Devil!' and all that. It's repetitious and kind of boring and one-dimensional, to me. Besides, there's nothing cool about Satan or death or stuff like that. If you listen to BLACK SABBATH, just to point out that their lyrics were really on the light side, about God and love and Jesus and all of that, so it's a misconception that heavy metal is supposed to be about the devil. Rap music, I love the original GRANDMASTER FLASH AND THE FURIOUS FIVE because they had something to say. They had some content in the lyrics. It was like the punk thing, like what Bob Dylan did back in the '60s, he brought the edge back into the music with his lyrics, mainly. There was some cool stuff about telling the truth and shaking up the foundation of the establishment, that kind of raising questions, questioning the authority, telling it like it is while still having a good time. You don't have to switch your brain off to have a good time. Rock and roll, to me, it's always been about being yourself and being an individual and thinking for yourself and doing your own thing and being `free.' Freedom of expression and everything.

quote 1: There is no change in their brief. However, they will not be travelling with the team for the overseas tours. They can guide the players when they are playing in India or practicing here as the scope of making a difference is greater. There is no need for them to travel abroad,
quote 2: Cook signed off from a scintillating series with a majestic 189 and Ian Bell (115) and Matt Prior (118 off 130 balls) further exposed the limitations of an attack that epitomised a very poor Australia side. Once England's bowlers had their foot on the throat, they didn't let up; Anderson, Tim Bresnan and Chris Tremlett shared the majority of the wickets but once again Graeme Swann put in a shift, getting through 28 overs at under three-an-over. When Tremlett bowled Michael Beer to complete victory by an innings and 83 runs, England embarked on a thoroughly deserved lap of honour around the SCG. It was a special moment for us all -- current and former players, fans and viewers at home, all of whom had waited so long to see witness such an achievement.

It's important at The Oval we try to get off to a really strong start especially in the first innings and those guys are more than capable of doing it. The way they've gone about things in practice and the runs they've scored in county cricket have been outstanding and now it's just about doing it in international cricket.

quote 0: I feel like, `Yes, we do need to win to go forward.' I don't think we need to swing for the fences because I think you have to put yourself in the right positions but you can't do stupid things to try and get there. We've got to find a little more speed in the race cars and I think that's been a consistent need for us. I think we've found some, but I don't think we've found enough. We have to keep working harder on that and put ourselves in positions. If we can get to the point where Joey can see it on the last restart, I have all the confidence in the world that I wouldn't put anybody else in the seat to close it out and get it done.
quote 1: Look at [ Stage 3 ]. Everyone thought we were going to ride around and have a 35-man bunch sprint at the end but it ended up deciding the entire race. I think cycling needs more of that. As bummed as I am about how things went yesterday, I think we need surprises, and I think the UCI needs to adapt as well. Maybe we need to take a lesson from roller derby. We need to animate it up a little bit.
quote 2: As you can see here, we have a very young team, a team that's very green that has to learn a lot, with some experienced riders add onto it, which makes a really nice combination for the race itself. Any result is a good result. We don't expect anything, we are here and we race hard, and it's just basically the motto that the team has had for the last nine years.
quote 3: It started as a discussion: What if Infiniti had created a race car in the 1940s? If one were to imagine an open-wheeled Infiniti racer on the famous circuits of the era, what would that look like,

Top quotes associated to the same topic: 
quote 0: Indeed, recent data show that in all graduate programs women outnumber men by more than a 4-3 ratio, but that field differences matter. Thus men get about 75 percent of the advanced degrees in Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Sciences, while women get slightly more than half the degrees in biological and agricultural sciences. No simple theory of discrimination can begin to account for this data. It is largely student selection that tends to drive the outcomes. But these raw numbers in quantitative areas matter far more for the tech jobs in Google than for work in management and sales. The observed distributions thus help explain the gender imbalance in tech jobs.
quote 1: This has links to pre-natal testosterone, and that explains a lot of the differences in career choice, for example teacher versus something like coding, where one is more people oriented and one is more things oriented,

quote 0: In addition, autonomy is often equivalent to `mob rule.' If you have 51% or more of the mining power, then you rule! Many groups had worried about this when ASIC chips were introduced, which were controlled by a few and proceeded to dominate BTC mining. That meant that individuals could no longer take part in performing the mining calculations effectively, and more worryingly, a few `pools' (large mining companies or groups) dominate the Proof-of-Work calculations for BTC today. The new Proof-of-Work for Bitcoin Gold attempts to bring mining more in line with Satoshi Nakamoto's vision of one CPU per miner, where everyone could be a node for tiny rewards. The new `equihash' algorithm runs on GPUs and not ASICS, meaning today's giant industrial mining outfits will not be able to mine Bitcoin Gold with existing equipment.
