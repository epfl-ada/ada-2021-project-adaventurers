quote 0: These are all original, provocative and in many instances ground-breaking films that could move the needle, so to speak.

quote 0: The way our bowlers bowled, I think we were more consistent,
quote 1: We've always backed our bowlers, we're a better bowling side than batting but in saying that they played some stupid shots too, I think they were a bit cocky and thinking they'd get more runs against us,
quote 2: I think our depth has been tested and they've done quite well. We've got Dirk Nannes sitting on the sidelines at the moment, he's been a little bit injured, but hopefully he's fully fit, he's a fantastic Twenty20 bowler. I think that's just what it comes down to, how well the depth is able to adapt on the day.
quote 3: You look at the batting, they have a strong line-up. Moreover, ODIs are a lot easier than Test cricket so bowlers will also do well.
quote 4: The execution of yorkers and bouncers becomes very crucial and that's what we have been working on in the last few days. The bowlers are doing pretty well with the yorkers and if they can replicate in the match, we will be very happy with it,

quote 0: I have always had thought Pacquiao would win... because ive studied Pacquiao's fight as I have also Mayweather's,
quote 1: Neither man is on a roll, but Alvarado took brutal punishment in each of his last four fights, two of which were against Rios. The struggles endured by Rios following the loss to Alvarado in their rematch continued in tough fights with Manny Pacquiao (L-UD12) and Diego Chaves (W-DQ9), but they appeared less exacting. Add to that Alvarado's recent outside troubles, and this looks like Rios ending their series inside the route.
quote 2: The loss to Pacquiao was harder to take. I knew I was fighting a legend and there's no shame in losing to one of the best. But I was down on myself because I was confident I had the tools to beat him. After the fight, I sat around and did nothing.
quote 3: That's what we're all about in the Golden Gloves and USA Boxing program,

quote 0: Slugout in the Dugout.
quote 1: A more advanced hitter than expected, he currently projects to bat.275 with 20-25 homers per season but could produce more power (and hit for less average) if he becomes more aggressive and turns on more pitches.
quote 2: But he's established himself the last few years and come out of the gates real strong just in terms of innings pitched and the amount of times he's taken the mound. That's invaluable for a starting guy.
quote 3: We got behind on a majority of the hitters that we faced and we never pitched ahead. When you pitch from behind you give up runs and hits. Offensively we need to swing at better pitches. We have kids that think it is not a strike and it takes them out of their ball game for the rest of their bat. We need to mature. We are immature when it comes to stuff like that. We need to grow up.
quote 4: We have to have more threat in the lineup for extra-base hits. We've only had six in four games and that's just not enough. We need to swing the bat with more authority.

quote 0: Don't underestimate the audience's intelligence and aesthetic sense when it comes to films,
quote 1: This is an incredible time to be a documentary filmmaker. People are doing work that is incredibly groundbreaking and risk-taking.
quote 2: With the support of the studios, we will continue to provide motion picture film, with its unparalleled richness and unique textures, to enable filmmakers to tell their stories and demonstrate their art.
quote 3: Nothing can prevent me from making films since when being pushed to the ultimate corners I connect with my inner-self and, in such private spaces, despite all limitations, the necessity to create becomes even more of an urge.
quote 4: I said you never make the film you set out to make, and this is particularly true about documentaries. Writing a novel, you can control it. With reality, you can't control it-it really continues to surprise you; in scary ways at times, also in ways that are great. Once you have all your footage, you look for a beginning, middle and a resolution. You have to create a creative arc, a structure. [ Making a ] documentary is very challenging that way. I said at the library that where I am ready to throw up my hands, I blindly keep going, and that this happens with every documentary I make. You go where it leads you.

His standard and his expectation for what he wants to do and achieve is so much higher than what any of us thinks. He's constantly changing things to give himself an opportunity to be at his best.

quote 0: Manu knows and accepts his responsibilities and has received a significant punishment in being excluded from the England squad and the club will also take internal disciplinary action. While we do not in any way condone his actions in this case, Manu is a young man who has grown up in the public eye and he is a good professional in a top-level environment. He always gives his time very generously to supporters, particularly young ones, wherever he goes, and fully understands the role that the fans have played in his career. We will continue to work closely with him on his return to full fitness and look forward to his return to the field in due course.

quote 0: This time it's more about what we're going through as human beings. We all experience similar things. I find that the world puts us in these boxes where we're only allowed to be one way -- like, `to succeed as a career woman, you need to do it this way,' or `to be a gay man, you have to be this way.' First of all, we're so much more complex than that. It's about breaking down those boundaries. The songs concentrate on concepts like that. As human beings, we like to identify with something, and as for me, I love people with a strong point of view.
quote 1: coudn't name a single song
quote 2: It meant so much that a great country artist like Brad put his faith in me, there wasn't a label at that point-Brad just believed we'd land in the right home here, and I do believe with Warner Nashville, I'm on the greatest label for me now. I feel spoiled to be around people who are on fire for music-especially after being in another situation that did not feel like that.
quote 3: We never wanted to just do massive build-up and drops in our songs because that's the trend and we don't want to follow trends because you end up falling off,
quote 4: I grew up three and a half hours from Nashville, and my parents just moved out of that home that I grew up in recently. So I grew up in a community that was all farmland and churches and school and a town square. So country is where I come from, and that's the kind of life I wanted to give my kids, and you can find that sort of life here in Nashville. Even though Nashville has so much more to offer, there is still a small town feel that I love.

quote 1: a 180-degree turn away from the biblical intent for marriage - as the Court also pushed aside states' rights and voters' voices,

Top quotes associated to the same topic: 
quote 0: It's disappointing to miss out on Q3 by such a small margin, but I can't complain too much about our performance today. I think my qualifying lap was pretty good and I felt I was pushing the car to its limit: unfortunately that wasn't enough, but I know it was our best effort.
quote 1: For sure, we lost some points in the last race, but we always have a good car at Petit and at our last test it was really good. I'm really confident for the race. I think Road Atlanta is a really good track for the Porsche. We have a strong lineup, a good team, and I'm pretty sure we have a good chance to win the race.
quote 2: I have to really thank the team for the excellent job they did to prepare the car for Race Three. Sadly, there were some issues which couldn't be solved at the track and I was off the pace. That's the way racing is. I am happy with the pace I had in practice and qualifying. I am just going to now focus and look forward to my next race this weekend in Nurburgring.
quote 3: Your teammates are even tougher. Ron was there for the taking and it ended up being a pedal fest. If I maybe caught it a little earlier or left a little earlier it may have been different, but at the end of the day we didn't get a win light, so we move on. All in all, we have to put this behind us and move on. There are no do-overs in drag racing. It's time to get focused and go out and try to win another championship.
quote 4: Obviously that is the most laps I think we have led other than maybe at Martinsville this entire year. Certainly the most we've led on a 1.5-mile. I'm very encouraged with the teams' efforts and the racecar. So much about what we do out there, especially as drivers, is having confidence, but also throughout the team, crew chief, you have to have confidence. These last couple of weeks has built our confidence up that has been knocked down this year. Richmond was one of our most solid races that we have put together all year long if you just look at pit road and restarts. Just the way the car ran, the adjustments, the communication and then to follow that up with Chicago and that strong of a racecar, even though it didn't end the way we wanted it to, our confidence is high. That is going to help us this weekend. The qualifying run that we made looked pretty good. We have to get through qualifying and see how we can evaluate what we have for tomorrow. When we hit it at this track, anything is possible for us. We feel like we are peaking at the right time. Certainly doing it at the beginning of the Chase is important, but we can't afford to have things happen like what happened on that last restart (last week). I can't do that here on Sunday with 10 (laps) to go. Lesson learned, hopefully.

quote 0: If I was still fighting, I'd be happy to fight Lemieux. He can whack and he's dangerous. I saw an interview with Golovkin. They played it like he's scared. I suppose he's cautious that he [ Lemieux ] can whack a bit. That's all he's got. Golovkin is on another level. He's ridiculously good. Not only can he whack, he's got boxing skills. He's phenomenal. He's unbelievable. Like I said, it's a 2-3 round job. The knockout percentage is in the 90s. It'll be a shocker if it goes farther than that. It's a fight that brings people out. They want to see that. It's just that they want to see people get hurt. We're nuts as a race. He's [ Lemieux ] a decent fighter. He's a world champion. Hassan N’Dam, he's a good fighter. But Golovkin is on another level,

quote 4: We know each other well and I wish him well. I understand that it's not his fault who he fights. His manager and promoter make decisions for him. He doesn't pick his opponents, but he's getting criticized for it. I've been in the same situation. I remember when I didn't choose who I fought. I had no power through the contracts to change anything. He's facing the same thing. He's extremely talented and an outstanding athlete. His knockout percentage speaks for itself.

quote 1: There are too many macro headwinds... it's an area of the market that we're not compelled to invest into currently,
quote 2: Institutional constraints and market inefficiencies are the primary reasons that bargains develop. Investors prefer businesses and securities that are simple over those that are complex. They fancy growth. They enjoy an exciting story. They avoid situations that involve the stigma of financial distress or the taint of litigation. They hate uncertain timing. They prefer liquidity to illiquidity. They prefer the illusion of perfect information that comes with large, successful companies to the limited information from companies embroiled in scandal, fraud, unexpected losses or management turmoil.

Since the start of our recent repurchase activity in Q4 2013, we have repurchased approximately 8.2 million shares, or approximately 21% of the fully diluted share count at the beginning of that period. We continue to believe that stock repurchases are an effective way of returning capital to shareholders, and plan to be opportunistic buyers of our stock in the coming quarters.

If you run into a situation where you have a 1-loss TCU, a 1-loss Baylor, a 1-loss Oklahoma State and a 1-loss Oklahoma, I think the Big 12 will be left out.

quote 1: I don't think it's wise to allow into our country refugees from an unstable place where we cannot determine who they are,
quote 2: His proposed policy of accepting thousands of Syrian refugees into American towns and cities is deeply misguided and puts the American people at risk. The safety and security of the American people is a nonnegotiable priority. Americans need to know their elected officials are doing everything we can to prevent similar acts of terror here at home. The American people are a compassionate people and desire to aid in the humanitarian crises occurring abroad. The U.S. has been more generous in aid efforts than any other country in the world and has given $4.5 billion in humanitarian relief for those affected by the war in Syria. Until refugees can be properly vetted, however, it would be unwise to allow them into the country.
