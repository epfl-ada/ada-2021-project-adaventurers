quote 3: I remember we were slow and we didn't make it because we were slow (laughs). Back then I was with Bill Davis with Ford and we were just lacking power and resources at the time. Did everything we could to have enough speed to make that race, but weren't able to pull it off. Ford made some big gains for the next year and we were pretty competitive the next year. Everywhere we went we were competitive, but in particular the restrictor plate tracks. Back then they just weren't known for being good on those restrictor plate tracks and we struggled. We did very well at all the other tracks. I mean it was frustrating to come here and not make the race. But at the same time we were pretty realistic about it we knew what was going on during testing. We weren't very fast. The thing that stands out the most to me was the very first time I ever came here I drove a Cup car. When we tested here I was driving the Nationwide car, but I got to get into Mark Martin's Cup car and go test it the very first time I was ever here. I was pretty blown away by that.probs: 1.0

quote 0: I looked forward to this first race, on the same circuit where I finished on the podium last year, although I knew this weekend wouldn't be easy with such very strong competition. During the practice sessions I didn't quite have the feeling on the front of the bike that I need to fully make use of the corners. But we'll continue working with the team to find a solution so we can take-up the battle again next weekend. My knee is troublesome with riding and this had its influence in my position on the bike, but this will improve in time.

quote 1: Due to logistic problems we are not able to run in Portugal. For us it is not possible to get in time in Hockenheim if we would drive in Montalegre.

quote 2: We were told we were on pole, although I thought weren't. As it turned out they made an error and we are in second place. Nevertheless today was quite a good day for us, we could show a good pace. We were lucky with the traffic, so we could manage the lap times we expected and broke the Endurance track record. It's really exciting when you realise that this is more or less a stock bike and that with small modifications it can do lap times like this. What Sheridan did today with extreme traffic of 60 bikes on track is incredible. His time is close to three seconds off the pace of Marc Marquez in the MotoGP, which is incredible. Sheridan and this bike fit perfectly together; they love each other and are in perfect harmony, so they enjoy the ride and go very fast.probs: 1.0
quote 3: It has been a very good and straightforward opening day and as this is another new circuit for me, we've been able to get into a good rhythm to help with acclimatisation. We made good progress through our set programme and now the focus tomorrow is on extracting a little more of the pace. A good day for the team.probs: 1.0

quote 5: Allowing for seasonal effects not uncommon in our business during the early part of the year, we are pleased to report solid results for the first quarter of 2015. Weakness in commodity prices, especially so in the case of oil products, has put a damper on origination volumes, even as demand continues to be strong. We have managed to compensate these effects by diversifying into other sectors, such as financial institutions, food and beverage, retail trade, among others, and remain committed to privilege well priced business over sheer volume growth. Regarding credit quality, we are carefully watching and managing our exposures in order to proactively address and minimize any potential impact on the bottom line, and with that we have only had to make minor adjustments to our reserve coverage levels. As confident as we are regarding the quality of our book of business, we continue to remain vigilant in case the operating environment for our client base suffers any adverse changes. Operating performance remains on track, and continues to show year-on-year improvements. On the fee income side, we are also making good progress even in the absence of a completed structured transaction this quarter. Our letters of credit business is diversifying away from higher risk environs, and the pipeline of transactions being worked on looks strong, leading us to remain confident regarding our ability to reach our fee income targets this year. We are aware of the headwinds impacting the economic development of the Region, with 2015 growth estimates now being lowered to levels similar to last year ´ s. Nevertheless, we believe that Bladex continues to be very well positioned to thrive in this environment.probs: 1.0

quote 1: It's an interesting question. I know I still would have been writing songs and whatnot. I don't know if I would have tapped into that inner rage, which had been sitting with me for a long time. You know, I grew up very poor. I was the poor kid, I was the kid that got picked on. It didn't matter what I tried to do, I always kind of felt the brunt of that anger. So, for me, I had a lot of reservoirs of rage sitting inside of me. And when I was doing STONE SOUR, before I did SLIPKNOT, I hinted at it a little bit, because it was the first time I was able to really embrace something that was good for me. I was a good songwriter, I was a good singer, a good frontman, so I knew that I had that in me. It wasn't until I joined SLIPKNOT, though, that I was able to really, kind of, unhinge everything and let go of all the tired messages that I felt... They were already out there, and I was chasing that tail and I needed to find my message. So, I guess, without SLIPKNOT, maybe I wouldn't have been able to, kind of, let it go. I, maybe, would have gotten there eventually, but I wouldn't have gotten there as quickly. And, to be honest, because of this band, I've been able to, kind of, reassert myself and find myself a lot quicker than I might have if it was just STONE SOUR or just the acoustic stuff that I do. I wouldn't be as solid as I am today if it wasn't for this band.probs: 1.0
quote 2: There are three songs from the point of view of family members. There's a song called `He Was Just a Boy,' from the point of view of the father. There's a song called `Brothers, Because of You' from the point of view of the brother. And a song called' I Love You More' from the point of view of the mother. It ends with a song called `The Narrow Bridge,' which has a hopeful view that maybe we've learned something from this tragedy, and we use what happened to Tyler to remind ourselves to be kind.probs: 1.0

quote 4: This time it's more about what we're going through as human beings. We all experience similar things. I find that the world puts us in these boxes where we're only allowed to be one way -- like, `to succeed as a career woman, you need to do it this way,' or `to be a gay man, you have to be this way.' First of all, we're so much more complex than that. It's about breaking down those boundaries. The songs concentrate on concepts like that. As human beings, we like to identify with something, and as for me, I love people with a strong point of view.probs: 1.0
quote 5: I just thought that it encompassed the album. I think it feels like myself or maybe how you always see the best version of yourself - so I see myself as a grand romantic in my relationships or even just the way that I want to have a positive outlook about the world.probs: 1.0

You have some individuals who understand our standard and our expectations in that room and they understood, you know, they understood the dynamics that was in that room. And now they understand the dynamics in how far we've come. And it's a standard and it's an expectation: it's Wide Receiver U. There's standards that we have to uphold, but they take great pride in their performance, they push each other, they're coaching each other. I think the addition of Jauan Jennings in that room -- anytime you add an individual of that competitiveness, that competitive character that he has -- I think it elevates the game. It elevates everyone's game, it elevates a room. But I think it's also Marquez Northhas been a very good leader of understanding. Josh Smith, even though he's missed some time out on the practice field, he's still leading. Alton [ Pig ] Howard has done a very good job at times of leading that room.

quote 1: I'm happy to finish third considering the difficult day I've had compared to yesterday. I have been struggling all day with the set up of my car, finding the grip and the balance.

Some places seem to favour one team and some others other teams, this time we have been having a pretty ok weekend so far.

quote 2: It was a hot day, so we were trying to extend my stint to make Ricky's a little bit shorter. I did two green-flag runs and they were pretty clean for the most part. We ran second for pretty much the whole day. I was behind the 01 for my first one and then was somewhat stuck behind the 31 for my second stint. That kind of opened up strategy a bit and stopped us early from behind the 31 when he couldn't jump into the pits. And Ricky pretty much kept it clean from there. The 31 pretty much took himself out of the race a little later. Same for the 5 car (Action Express Racing Corvette DP of Christian Fittipaldi and Joao Barbosa). And the 01 was too far ahead to catch. Second place, I think we're pretty happy with that today.probs: 1.0
quote 3: Completely my own fault that. We'd set a time that was good enough for Q3 and I was trying a few things on the way back around with my riding style and ways to exploit the bike's strong points even more. All I did was run wide and was running the kerb, so to avoid a crash I stood it up and ran onto what I thought was green painted asphalt, but what was instead wet Astroturf. I could have committed to the corner but thought it safer to run on, but as soon as I touched the Astroturf I was on my backside. A stupid, needless crash that's cost us. It's frustrating because we've been up there in every session really; and we should have been on the third, second, maybe even the front row. But I've made it hard work. The bike's working well though and I feel good, the guys have done a good job, so we'll keep working this evening and hopefully get some good results tomorrow.probs: 1.0

quote 3: I'm very happy and I enjoyed the race -- especially in the final part! I was a little bit distant from the battle in third. I couldn't find the way to go faster because I had problems when braking and cornering; it's been hard for us to find a good setup for the bike this weekend and I was able to be up at the front but without a good feeling. During the race I tried to counter this, but it was difficult. In the end I found the way to be faster and I was able to ride better and recover ground. When I caught up I saw that there were two laps remaining and I tried to attack, but when I overtook Marc I ran wide and he returned the pass. I am happy because what I can take from here -- as well as the third place in the race and fourth in the Championship -- is the attitude and the progress we have made in the final part of the season. We've been very strong and I hope that we can continue that this winter and next year.probs: 1.0

I'm learning on each movie the mysteries of this technical craft or that technical craft. I had things I specifically learned from this movie I want to apply to the next.
