You probably know you're going to get hit for boundaries but it can really get worse if you make that affect you. I have got him a few times now but I don't think there is anything in it.

But what surprised me most was how he `middled' almost every ball, be it in the pacer's net or the spinner's net. He even took throwdowns just like a player going through the batting drills does,

quote 1: On the flight from Singapore to Manila, I no longer wear a mask. It seems obvious by now that the danger lurks elsewhere: in all the people handling your passport and boarding passes, in the fingerprint sensors at immigration... If Singapore was all about planning and preparation, the mood in Manila is one of shock and fear... Eschewing a mask has become a status symbol, marking the healthy from the unhealthy, the strong from the weak. In the wealthiest parts of Manila, people's faces are bare.

quote 0: You know Pacquiao flies in and if Danny mistimes him, he is probably on the other end of a big combination. But, if Danny times him Pacquiao is on his ass. It's one of those fights where I think the level of success could be measured in both guys. They could both have a certain level of success. Both guys are mentally strong which I love. I love guys who are willing to go into the fire a little bit and be willing to go through what they have to go through to win a fight. I think it has all the ingredients to make a good fight,
quote 1: We got a guy named Ben Egli and Ben Egli is a local guy, but he's got an MMA record of 23 and 3, and he was King of the Cage champion and has traveled all over. He's been on the tip of Sean Shelby's tongue for about two years now. He's very, very good, he is stepping in. He's a black belt, he's going to take on Jake Ellenberger and Ben Egli is replacing Carlos Condit, and that's a very good fight. I mean, just for the MMA perspective. A lot of us didn't even know how good of a grappler Jake was until he did a Submission Underground taking on Diego Sanchez whose a well-decorated established black belt. Jake won that match so he's got a lot of people's respect, he's got a hard one here. He got dealt from the bottom of the deck with Ben Egli. Ben Egli is kind of long and gangly he's only lost one match that was to the great Craig Jones. So for MMA fans, I think everybody would like to see Jake Ellenberger compete some more.

quote 1: I said yes because the song is very beautiful, and it is a very soulful song. I have liked Vishal (the singer) since Kabir Singh's time because since then, he has gotten very famous. So when I heard the song, I could picture myself in the song and then I got very lucky with the team. Ali Fazal was a treat to work with, and the director Gurmmeet Singh is my favourite from the shoot because he is a sweetheart and he is really very sweet. The entire DOP and director team is that of Mirzapur, and there is Ali too, who is a part of the series, so for me, I got really lucky to be a part of such a strong team, and of course, Vishal is very talented and one of the top singers today. So yea, der aye, durust aye (smiles).
