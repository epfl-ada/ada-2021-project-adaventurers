The airports across the North Bay and North Coast are directly impacted by unprecedented travel restrictions and stay at home orders while still providing for the continued work of essential employees.

quote 3: The current operating environment for airlines is a disaster, but the short term headwinds aren't the only issue facing them. There's going to be a huge oversupply of planes for years coming out of this, there's going to be a bunch of out of work air workers, and there are going to be a bunch of unused gates/travel routes given the decrease in demand. You know what that sounds like a great environment for? Starting a new airline with a clean balance sheet to compete. The thesis on airlines for the past few years was `merged into a rational oligopoly that won't go into price wars again.'
